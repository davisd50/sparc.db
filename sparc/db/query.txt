Database query, result, and value components
---------------------------------------------
The Sparc toolkit interacts with many different types of data stores.  To help
ease integration of data from different sources, there are a series of 
high-level interfaces and components that can be used.

As always, we first need to configure the ZCA registry before we can use the
components

>>> from sparc.db import Configure
>>> Configure()

A Query
--------
A query is a simple interface used to store a string that can be used to 
query a database.

>>> from zope.component import createObject
>>> query = createObject(u"sparc.db.query", u"a simple query string")

>>> from sparc.db import IQuery
>>> IQuery.providedBy(query)
True

Query strings need to be unicode
>>> from zope.schema import ValidationError
>>> try:
...     createObject(u"sparc.db.query", "an invalid non-unicode string")
...     assert False
... except ValidationError:
...     pass
