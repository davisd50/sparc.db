Splunk Connection Info
-----------------------
In order to connect to Splunk to get the saved searches, we need to provide
connection details such as host and login information.  We provide this 
information within a componentized data structure providing
ISplunkConnectionInfo.

We can obtain an instance via its factory
>>> from zope.component import createObject
>>> connect_info = createObject(u'sparc.db.splunk.splunk_connection_info_factory')

Let's make sure it provides our expected interface
>>> from sparc.db.splunk import ISplunkConnectionInfo
>>> ISplunkConnectionInfo.providedBy(connect_info)
True

Let's also make sure we can update it with a regular dict contents
>>> connect_info.update({'host':'myhost'})
>>> connect_info['host']
'myhost'

Let's also make sure it still provides our expected interface after the update
>>> ISplunkConnectionInfo.providedBy(connect_info)
True

Splunk Saved Search Query Filter
---------------------------------
When retrieving saved searches from splunk it's important to have filtering
capabilities to find subsets based on their name.  A query filter is really
just a Python string whose intent is to contain a regex match string that can
be applied to saved searches retreived from Splunk.

We can obtain an instance via its factory
>>> filter = createObject(
...     u'sparc.db.splunk.splunk_saved_search_query_filter_factory',
...     'my test regex string')
>>> filter
'my test regex string'

Let's make sure it provides the expected interface
>>> from sparc.db.splunk import ISplunkSavedSearchQueryFilter
>>> ISplunkSavedSearchQueryFilter.providedBy(filter)
True
